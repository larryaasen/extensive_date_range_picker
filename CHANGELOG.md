## 1.1.3

- Updated branch name to make README images display.
When a package is published on http://pub.dev and it includes a screenshot in
the README, the package is published with a path to the image on GitHub.
It assumes the image is on branch master. My package used a branch named main,
so the images didn't show. Now, I use branch master.
